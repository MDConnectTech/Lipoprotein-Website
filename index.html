<section>
    <h2>What is Lipoprotein(a)?</h2>
    <p>Lipoprotein(a), abbreviated Lp(a), is a genetically determined lipoprotein particle similar to LDL cholesterol. Elevated levels are associated with increased risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and aortic valve stenosis.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
    <p>High Lp(a) levels are an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Unlike LDL cholesterol, Lp(a) levels are largely inherited and are not significantly affected by diet or lifestyle.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Who Should Be Tested?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Individuals with premature cardiovascular disease</li>
        <li>Family history of early heart disease</li>
        <li>Unexplained high LDL cholesterol</li>
        <li>Recurrent cardiovascular events despite standard therapy</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>How Is It Measured?</h2>
    <p>Lp(a) is measured with a blood test. Testing is generally recommended at least once in adulthood, particularly in individuals with cardiovascular risk factors.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Treatment Considerations</h2>
    <p>Currently, no widely approved therapies specifically lower Lp(a) significantly. Management focuses on aggressive control of other cardiovascular risk factors, including LDL cholesterol. Emerging therapies targeting Lp(a) are under clinical investigation.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <p><strong>Can diet lower Lp(a)?</strong><br>
    Lp(a) levels are primarily genetically determined and typically do not respond substantially to dietary modification.</p>

    <p><strong>How often should it be tested?</strong><br>
    In most individuals, Lp(a) testing is needed only once unless clinically indicated otherwise.</p>
